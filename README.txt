Plugin folder contains plugin development files

once you have your IDE installed, it'll ask you to select your workstation, MAKE SURE the directory is in the GitHub Desktop directory for
FruitHQ. an example path would be "D:\GitHub Desktop\FruitHQ\Plugin" this is where I chose my GitHub Desktop files to go everytime I load
a branch. Make sure to select the "Plugin" folder as that is the most crucial part of the directory.


Once u load the IDE go to "file" and Import "Team\Team Project Set" then select projectSet2 within the FruitHQ folder,
 and make sure you add/change spigot-1.14.4.jar AS AN EXTERNAL JAR in the libraries section once you've imported the project.

There's a compiled "Server Files" folder premade for 1.14.4, when testing plugins use this folder by starting the server with "run.bat"
if the server fails to load because of access denied. Try placing the folder elsewhere, place the plugin into the plugins folder inside the server files
and connect to the server using the ip, "localhost"  yes
