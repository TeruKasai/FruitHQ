Plugin folder contains plugin development files

once you have your IDE installed, import the project within the "Plugin" folder, and make sure you add spigot-1.14.4.jar AS AN EXTERNAL JAR in the libraries section.

There's a compiled "Server Files" folder premade for 1.14.4, when testing plugins use this folder by starting the server with "run.bat"
if the server fails to load because of access denied. Try placing the folder elsewhere, place the plugin into the plugins folder inside the server files
and connect to the server using the ip, "localhost"  yes
